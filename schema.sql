Participants will get a membership card after registering into the service, so they''ll be able to use the facilities who have joined the program across the city at certain times of the day.
As of today, fifty leisure centers have signed up to the scheme. Each one of them must offer one hour minimum of swimming time and one hour of gym time to H&F members. Specific exercise classes such as Zumba or Body Combat will also be made available besides the standard facilities. H&F classes will also be offered in schools and community centers. There will be guided cycling, and other activities intended for public spaces such as gymkhanas and half-marathons in parks.
Since it was announced last week, up to 200,000 people have signed up for the program. 60% of the registered come from minority groups. The majority of them were not members of any sports club before registering, half of them suffered from obesity, and a large portion acknowledged being in poor health. This indicates that the program is effectively reaching people who need it most.'),

1. The gorgeous views from the village and recreation ground will be blocked by the windmill towers and high fencing. Besides, the site may be considered brownfield once it has been built upon, thus making it an acceptable site for housing or industrial development. Thus, it does not comply with the local policy which states that developments must not adversely effect on the appearance or character of the landscape.
2. The recreation ground has recently undergone major reforms including a perimeter running track, new playground equipment and seating. It is being heavily used by families, sports teams and dog walkers, and is regularly used for village events. The massive building project will surely cause several disturbances and annoyances to residents intending to use them. Thus, the construction goes against the National Planning Policy Framework which requires developments to promote high quality public space and encourage the active and continual use of public areas.
3. There has been no assessment yet of the extent to which noise from the windmills will affect the residents, but we may rightfully assume that such noise will cause deep disturbances in the neighborhood.'),
